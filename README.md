## Horisean
The first change made to the HTML code was fixing the structure of elements for a more efficient way to begin correcting and consolidating lines. Many images needed to be updated with a accessible alt attribute to meet standards. Images and paragraphs using the same css style were changed to a new class that cleaned up our style page. Title of webpage needed to be changed to the title of the website for easy optimization for search engines. Links st the top of the page were fixed. All changes were recorded in the html and css files.
